# ABRL-Med
ABRL-Med: Adaptive Agent-Based Reinforcement Learning for Personalized Chronic Disease Management is an innovative project utilizing Agent-Based Reinforcement Learning (ABRL) to develop adaptive, personalized treatment plans for chronic disease management. Chronic illnesses like diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease require ongoing, individualized care strategies to optimize patient health outcomes. This project leverages ABRL to model patient-specific interactions with various treatments over time, learning and adapting to each patientâ€™s unique medical needs and responses. By training reinforcement learning agents on longitudinal medical data, ABRL-Med dynamically optimizes treatment plans, aiming to improve health outcomes, reduce adverse events, and support clinicians in decision-making.

Features:
-Agent-Based Modeling of Patient Profiles: Each patient is modeled as an autonomous agent that interacts with diverse treatment options in a simulated environment.
-Adaptive Learning: The reinforcement learning model continuously learns from patient responses, adjusting treatment recommendations to optimize health outcomes.
-Medical Data-Driven Decisions: Analyzes real-world medical data, capturing complex patterns to tailor individualized care.
-Goal-Oriented Rewards System: The agent receives positive rewards for improving patient outcomes and penalizes adverse events, promoting long-term health benefits.

Project Goals:
-Provide a proof-of-concept for personalized, AI-driven healthcare using reinforcement learning.
-Develop tools to assist clinicians in tailoring treatment plans based on evolving patient health data.
-Create a scalable, ethical model for chronic disease management adaptable to different diseases and patient profiles.
